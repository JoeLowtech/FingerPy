Produktbeschreibung:
The fingerprint module from ADH-Tech communicates over TTL Serial so you 
can easily embed it into your next project. The module itself does all of 
the heavy lifting behind reading and identifying the fingerprints with an 
on-board optical sensor and 32-bit CPU. All you need to do is send it simple 
commands. To get started, just register each fingerprint that you want to 
store by sending the corresponding command and pressing your finger against 
the reader three times. The fingerprint scanner can store different fingerprints 
and the database of prints can even be downloaded from the unit and distributed 
to other modules. As well as the fingerprint "template," the analyzed version 
of the print, you can also retrieve the image of a fingerprint and even pull 
raw images from the optical sensor. The module can store up to 200 different 
fingerprints. It is small and easy to mount using two mounting tabs on the 
side of the sensor. The on-board JST-SH connector has four signals: Vcc, GND, 
Tx, Rx.
